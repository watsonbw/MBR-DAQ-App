## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report all vulnerabilities to the core project maintainers. You can reach us at watsonbw@umich.edu or trevor.swan@case.edu.

Vulnerabilities may include (but are not limited to) memory access violations, race conditions or thread safety violations, network request vulnerabilities, or anything else related. Since this is a public facing app that is used at Baja racing events, security is very important. We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 72 hours whenever possible.

We ask that you submit security vulnerabilities to us privately through the emails above, only publishing them as an issue if you do not hear back from us within the following month.

For vulnerabilities related to vendored code, please mention if a patch has been made to address the vulnerability. Otherwise, report to the vendored library itself.
